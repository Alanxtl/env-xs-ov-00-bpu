# The first phase of Open Verification for the Kunminghu microarchitecture of Xiangshan: Kunminghu's BPU Module UT Verification in Action.

[中文文档](Readme_cn.md)

This project aims to explore open-sourced subdivision verification of the high-performance open-source RISC-V OpenXiangshan processor's microarchitecture. It introduces new tools and methods based on Python, enabling all students interested in chip design and verification to quickly grasp and study the XiangShan microarchitecture. This phase provides a detailed introduction to the principles and implementation of the branch prediction module of the XiangShan Kunminghu architecture, along with the corresponding open-source verification environment. Participants in this phase can earn points and rewards by submitting bugs, writing verification reports, and more.
